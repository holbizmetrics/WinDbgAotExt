# WinDbgAotExt

A **C# NativeAOT WinDbg extension** — and, more importantly, the crash-proof native bridge for a larger goal.

## The dream (why this exists)

A **live C# scripting engine inside WinDbg.** Host the C# runtime compiler (Roslyn) in the
extension so that, sitting at a WinDbg prompt against a live process or a dump, you **write C# on
the fly and it compiles and runs immediately against the target** — no edit → rebuild → reload
cycle. It is the C# answer to WinDbg's built-in JavaScript provider (`dx` / `.scriptload`), but
with the full weight of C# and the entire .NET library ecosystem behind it.

What that unlocks (**mostly shipped now** — see [Status](#status): running live C#, *calling / piping /
reformatting* commands (`!cs` + `debugger.Run`), and *reading target memory* (`debugger.ReadU64`) all
work today; only the *heap/threads-as-typed-queryable-objects* snippet just below is still the goal):

- **Query the debuggee like a database.** Expose threads, modules, the heap, handles as queryable
  sources and use **LINQ** as your debugger query language:
  ```csharp
  Debuggee.Heap.Objects
      .GroupBy(o => o.TypeName)
      .Select(g => new { Type = g.Key, Count = g.Count(), Bytes = g.Sum(o => o.Size) })
      .OrderByDescending(x => x.Bytes)          // leak hunt: biggest types first
  ```
- **Call and pipe existing commands.** Run any WinDbg command (`IDebugControl::Execute`), capture
  its output, then parse / LINQ / transform it in C# and **pipe** the result onward — wrapping the
  whole battle-tested command surface (`!analyze`, `k`, `lm`, `!heap`, …).
- **Reformat output to be understandable.** Turn a cryptic wall of dbgeng text into a sorted table,
  a filtered summary, a diff — raw output in, readable view out.
- **Automate triage.** Prototype an analysis in ten lines and run it interactively; script memory
  reads via `IDebugDataSpaces`; walk native structures declaratively.

For chasing something like a misbehaving native client, that is the "tremendous help."

## Why NativeAOT — the two-layer architecture

The dream cannot be "an AOT extension that compiles and runs C#," because **NativeAOT has no JIT**:
Roslyn compiles C# to IL, IL needs a JIT to execute, and AOT has no runtime code generation
(`Expression.Compile()` — the engine behind `IQueryable` / expression-tree LINQ — throws under AOT).
So the design is two layers:

- **Layer 1 — the AOT native bridge (this repo today).** A dependency-free DLL that loads cleanly
  into dbgeng and crosses the native ↔ managed boundary *safely*: exceptions are caught before they
  can escape an `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` export (an escaping managed exception has no native unwind
  info and fail-fasts the debugger), vtable calls use exact signatures and indices, and no
  GC-movable pointer escapes to the caller. **This is the "safely enter and return" problem** that
  makes these extensions crash — solved and tested here.
- **Layer 2 — hosted CoreCLR + Roslyn (the north star).** The AOT bridge boots a full JIT-capable
  runtime in-process (via `nethost` / `hostfxr`), and *that* runtime hosts Roslyn and runs your live
  C# — LINQ, expression trees, `async`, reflection, the whole language. The AOT shim is the seatbelt;
  CoreCLR is the engine.

## Status

**Layer 1 — complete.** The extension loads into a real debugger, dispatches commands, prints
output through the live `IDebugControl::Output` path, and returns cleanly — no crash.

- Exports: `DebugExtensionInitialize` (reports v1.1), `DebugExtensionUninitialize`,
  `DebugExtensionNotify`, plus demo commands `hello`, `echo`, `version`.
- Command dispatch through `CommandHost` with a UTF-8 arg parser; output via the `IDebugControl`
  vtable (`Output` is index **14**, not 8 — a real bug fixed in `0a4dcbc`, **confirmed live**).
- **Three independent test layers, all green:**
  - `WinDbgAotExt.Tests` — xUnit, **17/17**: the `Argv` parser (11) **plus the native Output path**
    (6). `DbgEngOutputTests` hand-builds a mock `IDebugClient`/`IDebugControl` with real native
    vtables, puts a capturing function at `Output` index 14, and asserts the exact bytes each
    command emits through `enter → QueryInterface → dispatch → Output → return`. No WinDbg needed.
  - `tools/load-harness.ps1` — native ABI proof *without WinDbg*, **14/14**: LoadLibrary the AOT
    DLL, resolve every export, call `DebugExtensionInitialize` (assert `S_OK` + version
    `0x00010001`), dispatch the commands on the null-client path.
  - **Live `.load` in cdb** — the definitive test against real dbgeng:
    ```
    cdb -c ".load WinDbgAotExt.dll; !hello world; !version; q" cmd.exe
      -> Hello from C# Native AOT! args=[world]
      -> 1.1
    ```
    loads, prints via the real Output vtable[14], and quits with no crash. (The Store WinDbg
    package ships a scriptable `cdb.exe` under `…\amd64\cdb.exe`.)

**Layer 2 — core working.** The extension boots CoreCLR in-process (via `hostfxr`) and runs live
C# through Roslyn. Load it and type C# at the debugger prompt:

```
cdb> .load WinDbgAotExt.dll
cdb> !clrtest
CLR Ping returned: 4242
cdb> !cs 1 + 2
3
cdb> !cs Enumerable.Range(1,10).Where(x => x % 2 == 0).Sum()
30
cdb> !cs debugger.Exec("? 5 + 5")                        # run a WinDbg command from C#
Evaluate expression: 10 = 0xa
cdb> !cs debugger.Run("lm").Split('\n').Where(l => l.Length > 0).Count()   # LINQ over its output
21
cdb> !cs debugger.ReadU32(0x7ffe0000).ToString("x8")    # read raw target memory (matches `dd`)
00000000
```

Scripts reach the live target through a `debugger` object (the debug client, handed in per command):
- `debugger.Exec("cmd")` — run a WinDbg command.
- `debugger.Run("cmd")` — run it **and return the output as a string**, so you can parse / LINQ /
  reformat it (the "call → pipe → reformat" pillar).
- `debugger.ReadBytes(addr, n)` / `ReadU64(addr)` / `ReadU32(addr)` — read raw target memory
  (`IDebugDataSpaces::ReadVirtual`), cross-checked to agree with the debugger's own `dd`.

Every dbgeng call goes through vtable indices verified against `dbgeng.h` (`IDebugControl::Execute`=66,
`IDebugClient::Get/SetOutputCallbacks`=33/34, `IDebugOutputCallbacks::Output`=3,
`IDebugDataSpaces::ReadVirtual`=3), each anchored by the known-good `Output`=14 — never guessed (a
wrong index is this project's signature crash).

- Native AOT (no CoreCLR of its own) → `hostfxr_initialize_for_runtime_config` is the *first* init in
  the debugger process, which is why hosting works (a managed host fails `0x80008081`).
- `layer2/bridge` = the managed "brain" (Roslyn + the `Debugger` debuggee surface); `layer2/host` =
  the standalone AOT-hosts-CoreCLR spike; `WinDbgAotExt/ClrHost.cs` boots the runtime behind
  `!clrtest` / `!cs`.
- Deploy = the extension DLL + a `bridge/` subfolder (bridge DLL + Roslyn deps + runtimeconfig).
- **Remaining (all optional — the hard architecture is done):** expose threads / modules / heap as
  typed *queryable objects* so you LINQ the process *state* itself, not just command text or raw bytes
  (the `Debuggee.Heap` snippet at the top — needs symbol/type interop, à la ClrMD); optionally swap raw
  `CSharpScript` for `EvaluatorLib` for globals ergonomics (net9↔net10 align).

## Build & test

```powershell
# Build the AOT extension DLL (needs the .NET SDK + the VS C++ toolchain for the native link step)
dotnet publish WinDbgAotExt/WinDbgAotExt.csproj -c Release -r win-x64
#   -> WinDbgAotExt/bin/Release/net9.0-windows/win-x64/publish/WinDbgAotExt.dll

# Unit tests (managed)
dotnet test WinDbgAotExt.Tests/WinDbgAotExt.Tests.csproj

# Native ABI harness (no WinDbg required)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/load-harness.ps1
```

To load it in WinDbg once you have the DLL:

```
.load C:\path\to\WinDbgAotExt.dll   (needs the bridge/ subfolder alongside it — see Status)
!hello world
!version
!cs Enumerable.Range(1,10).Sum()                  # live C# + LINQ
!cs debugger.Run("lm").Split('\n').Length         # LINQ over a command's output
```

| `layer2/host/Host.cs` | standalone AOT-hosts-CoreCLR spike (proves the seam without WinDbg) |
| `WinDbgAotExt.Tests/ArgvTests.cs` | xUnit parser coverage |
| `WinDbgAotExt.Tests/DbgEngOutputTests.cs` | mock `IDebugControl` — tests the Output vtable[14] path without WinDbg |
